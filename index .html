About Me
From Practice to Theory, From Management to Learning Design
🌟
My Journey
My path to IT & Learning began in an unexpected place—managing digital content platforms in China's rapidly evolving tech industry. As General Manager's Assistant at Hangzhou Rolling Elephant Network Technology Co. Ltd., I oversaw operations for TikTok, Douyin, and Xiaohongshu (Rednote), witnessing firsthand how technology transforms communication and knowledge sharing.
But it was my dual role as a project manager and a mother that truly sparked my interest in educational technology. While establishing company workflows and coordinating cross-departmental teams, I observed how digital tools could either facilitate or hinder learning processes. As a parent, I questioned how platforms like TikTok influence children's development—a question that would later become the focus of my academic research.
From 2012 to 2015, I volunteered teaching Chinese calligraphy to kindergarten children. This hands-on experience with early learners revealed the gap between educational content design and children's actual learning needs. I saw how the right combination of physical materials, visual guidance, and adult support could unlock children's creative potential. Yet I also witnessed how poorly designed digital tools could overwhelm young minds rather than support them.
These experiences converged into a realization: technology is not inherently good or bad for learning—its impact depends on thoughtful design, appropriate context, and human mediation. To contribute meaningfully to this field, I needed theoretical frameworks and research methodologies. This is why I pursued the Master's program in IT & Learning at the University of Gothenburg.
💡
Why IT & Learning?
Three interconnected motivations drive my academic pursuit:
		As a digital platform manager: I saw technology's power to scale communication and engagement. Platforms I managed reached millions of users, but I lacked the theoretical foundation to evaluate their educational value critically. I wanted to understand learning theories, instructional design principles, and evidence-based practices. As a mother and volunteer educator: I experienced the anxiety many parents face: How much screen time is appropriate? Which content supports development? What role should adults play? These questions cannot be answered through intuition alone—they require rigorous research and evidence. From project management background: I learned that successful implementation requires more than good intentions. Educational technology initiatives fail when they ignore organizational contexts, user needs, or change management principles. I want to bridge the gap between educational research and real-world implementation.
🎯
The Manager's Lens
I understand organizational dynamics, resource constraints, and implementation challenges. I know that successful edtech solutions must be scalable, sustainable, and aligned with institutional goals.
📚
The Researcher's Lens
Through my Master's studies, I'm developing skills in literature review, research methodology, critical analysis, and academic writing. I approach problems systematically and ground arguments in evidence.
❤️
The Parent-Educator's Lens
I empathize with learners' needs, value developmentally appropriate design, and appreciate the irreplaceable role of human interaction. Technology should enhance—not replace—human connection in learning.

The Impact of Animated Videos on Preschool Children's Language Development
Project Overview
This course paper examines how animated videos—increasingly prevalent on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and streaming services—affect preschool children's language development. Through a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, I analyzed five empirical studies to answer: Do animated videos help or hinder vocabulary acquisition? What factors moderate these effects? How do these findings inform educational technology design?

Context & Motivation
This research topic emerged from the convergence of my professional experience and personal concerns. At Hangzhou Rolling Elephant Network Technology, I managed content operations for TikTok and Douyin, witnessing millions of young children consuming short-form video content. As a mother, I faced daily decisions about my child's media use. I wanted evidence-based answers grounded in learning theories like Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, Piaget's cognitive development stages, Mayer's multimedia learning principles, and Sweller's cognitive load theory.
Research Process
		Conducted systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines Searched Scopus and ERIC databases with comprehensive search strategy Six-stage screening process: 196 articles → 5 final studies Applied rigorous inclusion criteria focusing on empirical studies from 2024-2025 Analyzed findings through multiple theoretical lenses
Key Findings
The research revealed that animated videos can support preschool children's language development when designed thoughtfully. Critical factors include adult co-viewing and mediation, age-appropriate content design, interactive elements that promote engagement, cultural and linguistic considerations, and balancing entertainment with educational value. The findings emphasize that technology's educational impact depends on design quality and social context.
Theoretical Frameworks Applied
		Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory (role of adult mediation) Piaget's Cognitive Development Stages (age-appropriate design) Mayer's Multimedia Learning Principles (effective content design) Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory (managing complexity)
